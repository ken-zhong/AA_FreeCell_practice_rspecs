## FreeCell RSPEC Practice ##

Here's my attempt at creating some practice RSPECs! Let me know if there's any bugs are issues. It doesn't fully "work" as a game, but most of the core logic should be there.

Note: The card/deck classes are not exactly the same as the ones from the BlackJack practice assessment!
